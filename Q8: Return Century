// Question 8:
// Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the year 1 up to and including the year 100, 
// the second - from the year 101 up to and including the year 200, etc.
// Example:
// For year = 1905, the output should be = 20; For year = 1700, the output should be = 17.



let year = 1905 ; // Here we initiliazing the m variable and taking the year 1905
let century = Math.ceil(year/100); // Here we are using ceil to round up the number 
console.log(century);
